Korean Center — Header demo (Vite + React + TailwindCSS)

What's included:
- A polished animated Header component (src/components/Header.jsx)
- Tailwind config, PostCSS, and basic Vite setup files
- public/logo.png (your provided logo)

How to run locally:
1. unzip or extract the project
2. cd korean-center-header
3. npm install
4. npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/tailwind-output.css --watch  (optional but you can also rely on PostCSS)
   OR simply run: npm run dev  (Vite + Tailwind should work after install)
5. open http://localhost:5173/

Notes:
- This ZIP includes source files only. You must run npm install to fetch dependencies.
- The logo is already placed at public/logo.png — replace it if you want.
